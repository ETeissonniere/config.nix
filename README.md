# config.nix

My Macs, NixOS machines, and dotfiles, managed with
[Nix](https://nixos.org/), [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin),
[nh](https://github.com/nix-community/nh), and [deploy-rs](https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs).
NixOS installation uses [nixos-anywhere](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere)
and [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko).

## macOS setup

Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) and Apple's command-line tools
(`xcode-select --install`), then open a new terminal. Choose a host from `hosts/`
and check its architecture, username, and UID (`id -u`).

For the first activation (replace `wintermute` with your host):

```sh
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' shell --inputs-from . nixpkgs#just nixpkgs#nh
just host=wintermute check
just host=wintermute switch
exit
```

This installs `nh` and `just`; restart your terminal afterward.
Homebrew is managed automatically; activation
upgrades declared packages and removes unlisted packages and associated cask data.

Each Mac provisions a `default` key for SSH and Git signing.
Use `scauth pubkey default` to retrieve its public key
for your servers, and save it on GitHub as both an authentication and signing key.

## Usage

`host` defaults to this machine's hostname, lowercased (for example, `Wintermute`
becomes `wintermute`); override it before the recipe: `just host=wintermute check`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just check [host]` | Evaluate a host; defaults to this machine |
| `just check-all` | Evaluate all Darwin and NixOS configurations |
| `just build [host]` | Build a host without applying; defaults to this machine |
| `just deploy [host]` | Deploy NixOS updates with deploy-rs |
| `just install [host] [user@address]` | Install NixOS; erases the host's configured disks |
| `just switch` | Build and apply this Mac's configuration with `nh` |
| `just update` | Update pinned dependencies without applying |
| `just format` | Format Nix files and recipes |

Run `just` to list recipes. Run `just check` and `just build` before switching.
Automatic Nix garbage collection runs weekly with 30-day retention. Keep
`stateVersion` values unchanged.
